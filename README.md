# IPL-Analysis
I have created a dashboard using Power BI which shows IPL data from year 2008 - 2025. The dashboard contains different kpi's with player information and match information. You can see every year IPL winner, Runner up, Orange cap winner, Purple Cap winner. Alongwith Total matches, sixes, fours, centuries.
